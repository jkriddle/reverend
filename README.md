# The Reverend

## Intro/Backstory
The Reverend is 2 2D, open-world, sandbox survival game featuring a top-down UI (similar to old-school RPGs).
It is set in the modern day world after a global economic collapse. The population has been decimated after a 
chain of events leading to wordlwide riots, overthrown governments, destruction of power grids, lawlessness, and 
widespread panic.

You play The Reverend, a former member of a small survival community. While you were never a religious man, you 
received the "Reverend" moniker from your leadership and guideance of the community. However, as is common in the 
post-modern age, the community was attacked by a bandit group and many were killed or fled during the attack. 

You are now on your own. Build your own compound or seek out other communities for help. Whatever you can do to 
survive. How long will you last?
